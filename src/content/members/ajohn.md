Hello, my name is Arion John I attend Medgar Evers Preparatory School and the Brooklyn STEAM Center.
I am 16 years old and some of my interests are Track and Field, playing video games and watching movies
and tv shows. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Living with both of my parents, I have had a very rough
and fun educational journey. I have taken alot of AP courses, regents courses, learning different languages and 
other challenging courses. 

I hope to pursue a career in Computer Science, having alot of experience I am a Full Stack Developer at the Brooklyn STEAM Center and I inspire to become a Computer Software Engineer. Welcome to my personal Website so sit back, browse, explore and learn about me! I began to have an interest in computer science and programming in elementary school when I was introduced to coding. From there, I always wanted to code and become a programmer, and make my own designs and learn about different computer languages and how they work. But before STEAM, as said before I also attend Medgar Evers Prepartory School where I learn about Java and JavaScript aswell.
