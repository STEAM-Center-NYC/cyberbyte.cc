Hi! Im Leilani Dore ,a student attending Bedford Academy and Brooklyn STEAM Center as a Junior. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and enjoy reading, swimming, and video games. I also enjoy seeing how I can improve in everything I does is what motivates me to achieve my goals. Leilani sees her academics in both Bedford Academy and the STEAM program as a top priority and will do what she needs to so that she can fulfill her goals.
