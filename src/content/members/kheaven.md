I was born in America, specifically in New York City. I live with my two brothers, and my mother and father.
My family has a very deep Jamaican backgorund, and decided to move over to America 
few months after I was born. I went to P.S. 135 for 2-5th grade, and at the time of making this website,
I am currently learning at not only Medgar Evers College Prepatory School, but also the STEAM Center.

Growing up, I was very non-verbal. When I was still young I didn't talk much and I mainly
pointed to communicate. Over time I learned to express myself in a more verbal manor. Making friends was
"tricky" to say the least. I was, and still am, a very sensitive person. But, during my time at Medgar
and meeting the vast variety of people really helped me open up by an extravagent amount.
I am Kyle Heaven, and this is my story.
