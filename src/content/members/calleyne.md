My name is christian Alleyne. I am a junior in highschool and I attend classes at the brooklyn steam center for programming and this is one of my projects. I am a big fan of video games and just got done building my own PC and having it work in of 2024 which has me all kinds of exited. I am pretty introverted but I know when I need to become social and i'm able to talk to others.
